🚀 DevOps Bootcamp: Final Project
Welcome to the documentation for my DevOps Bootcamp final project! This repository showcases a complete end-to-end automation pipeline, from infrastructure provisioning to live monitoring.

🎯 Project Objectives
By completing this project, I am demonstrating the ability to:

Provision AWS Infrastructure: Using Terraform as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to build a scalable and repeatable cloud environment.

Configuration Management: Applying Ansible to automate the setup and configuration of web and monitoring servers.

Containerized Deployment: Deploying a containerized web application using Docker and Amazon ECR.

Infrastructure Monitoring: Implementing a full monitoring stack using Prometheus and Grafana for real-time visibility.

DevOps Best Practices: Utilizing industry-standard automation, CI/CD workflows, and security measures.

Technical Documentation: Publishing and maintaining project documentation via GitHub Pages.
